# Usage:
# curl -fsSL https://jumpkick.build/install.sh | bash
# wget -qO- https://jumpkick.build/install.sh | bash
# bash install.sh [/path/to/jk[.xz|.zip]]
# Environment variables:
# JK_ARCHIVE_URL Override the archive URL to download. Supports.xz and
# .zip (a plain uncompressed binary also works for local
# files). Defaults to the latest release matching this
# machine's OS/arch and available extractor.
# JK_RELEASES_URL Override the release site root (mirrors).
# JK_VERSION Install a specific version instead of the latest.
# JK_INSTALL_DIR Override the install directory (default: ~/.jk/bin).

# ---- terminal / interactivity detection ------------------------------------
# Two independent signals, resolved once:
# * ansi — gated on stdout being a real terminal (and not NO_COLOR / a dumb
# or unset TERM), so piped/redirected output stays clean. Also drives
# which glyphs we print: the ● / ✖ marks assume a UTF-8-ish terminal that
# can also do escape codes, so a non-ANSI terminal gets plain ASCII
# stand-ins instead of risking a `?`/tofu box.
# * interactivity — whether a controlling terminal is reachable at all. Under
# `curl … | bash`, fd 0 is the PIPE feeding bash the script, NOT a tty, so
# `[ -t 0 ]` is the wrong probe — /dev/tty is. This drives TTY_IN, the stdin
# every child `jk` command is given: a real terminal when one exists (so
# jk's own prompts / console detection work), else /dev/null. Routing
# children away from the script's stdin also stops a child from consuming
# the rest of the piped script — the classic `curl | bash` truncation.
# Honour CI and JK_NONINTERACTIVE to force the non-interactive path explicitly.

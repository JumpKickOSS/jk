# ---- terminal / interactivity detection ------------------------------------
#
# Two independent signals, resolved once:
#   * ansi — gated on stdout being a real terminal (and not NO_COLOR / a dumb
#     or unset TERM), so piped/redirected output stays clean. Also drives
#     which glyphs we print: the ● / ✖ marks assume a UTF-8-ish terminal that
#     can also do escape codes, so a non-ANSI terminal gets plain ASCII
#     stand-ins instead of risking a `?`/tofu box.
#   * interactivity — whether a controlling terminal is reachable at all. Under
#     `curl … | bash`, fd 0 is the PIPE feeding bash the script, NOT a tty, so
#     `[ -t 0 ]` is the wrong probe — /dev/tty is. This drives TTY_IN, the stdin
#     every child `jk` command is given: a real terminal when one exists (so
#     jk's own prompts / console detection work), else /dev/null. Routing
#     children away from the script's stdin also stops a child from consuming
#     the rest of the piped script — the classic `curl | bash` truncation.
#
# Honour CI and JK_NONINTERACTIVE to force the non-interactive path explicitly.
